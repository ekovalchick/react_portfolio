      My name is Elizabeth Kovalchick and I am currently pursuring a Full-Stack Development Certification
                through Miami University. I am also a full time Civil Engineer. I graduated from Cleveland State
                University with a Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering. As I continue my career as a engineer I see
                a need for technological advances in the Construction world. Being an engineer means spending most of
                your days working long hours and less time to enjoy life. I think we need to implement more technology
                to make task simplier and less time consuming. One day my technical paths will cross and I wil be able
                to create products to help make users life easier.
